# Animation-Donut
To create a spinning donut animation in C programming language, we can use the principles of graphics programming to generate a series of frames that when played in sequence, create the illusion of a spinning donut.

The first step would be to initialize a graphics window using a library such as SDL or OpenGL. Once the window is initialized, we can draw the outline of a donut using a series of circles and lines. We can then fill in the donut shape using a color of our choice.

To create the spinning effect, we can rotate the donut by a certain angle and redraw it in a new position. This process can be repeated at regular intervals to create the illusion of continuous motion. We can adjust the speed and direction of the rotation to create different effects.
